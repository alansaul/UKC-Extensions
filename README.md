# UKC-Extensions
Little place to keep convenience extensions for UKClimbing.

## Remove likes

Will just remove the likes and dislike buttons for anyone who prefers not to see them.

### For Firefox

Click "Download Zip", unzip it, navigate to "about:addons" in firefox, click the little clog button with the arrow, click "Install Add-on from File", navigate to where you unzipped and choose the "remove_likes-0.0.6-fx+an.xpi" file, and accept the installation.

### For Chrome

Just click "Download Zip", unzip it, navigate to "chrome://extensions/" in your browser, enable "developer mode" and then click "Load unpacked extension...". Select the folder called chrome_remove_likes and the extension will install.
